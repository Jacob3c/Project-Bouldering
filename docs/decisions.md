# Decision log

Short entries: what was decided, why, and what else was considered.

## 2026-11-10 - Project structure
- **Decision:** `src/` layout with one module per pipeline stage (ingest, pose, transforms, quality, render, pipeline).
- **Why:** each stage can be tested and rerun on its own; orchestration only wires them together.

## 2026-11-10 - Two pose models behind one interface
- **Decision:** wrap MediaPipe Pose Landmarker and RTMPose (via rtmlib) behind a shared `PoseBackend` interface with one output schema; store `model_name` and `model_version` on every row.
- **Why:** lets the models be compared on the same clips and the pipeline be rerun when the model changes, without touching downstream code.
- **Considered:** YOLO-pose (ankle-only feet, AGPL licence).
- **Open:** pick the default model after comparing both on test clips.
